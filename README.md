Hi, my name is Nicolas, I'm 18 years old, I live in Rio de Janeiro and I've been involved with the world of programming since I was 12 years old.

My first contact with programming was through game servers like Minecraft, SA:MP, MU Online, etc. I've always been very interested in developing these servers and I learned a lot from it.

At 16, I started studying web and mobile development, using nodeJS on the back-end and React / Native on the front-end. To learn more, I attended Rocketseat's Gostock 8 bootcamp, where I had an amazing insight.
